          application generates a realistic 3D avatar from a facial image, which

          The avatar is generated using a face texture mapping, which is
          replaced by an uploaded image. To create a realistic avatar, the
          model's eye and nose coordinates are aligned with those of the
          uploaded image, using vectors and matrices to perform coordinate
          calculations. The following is the 3D avatar generation process I have
          made:
