            A dedicated backend developer with over 2 years of experience and a
            passion for problem-solving and creating efficient solutions. I have
            experience working with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, and AWS. I
            take pride in my ability to learn and adapt quickly, as well as my
            commitment to delivering high-quality work to my clients and team
            members. I enjoy dedicating time to learning about new technologies
            and honing my skills to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving field.

          <Text pb="5">
            Apart from my passion for backend development, I love traveling and
            exploring new cultures. My journey around Asia and my time spent
            living in Sydney have enriched my life experiences and broadened my
            perspective. I enjoy taking on challenges, such as reaching the
            Everest Base Camp in Nepal.
